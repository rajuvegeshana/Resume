    <h2><strong>ABOUT</strong></h2>
    <p> I am a multidisciplinary designer with a curious mind, I enjoy to meet new people and understand how they are solving problems, this is one of the reasons why I invest my time on meetups from product management to everything related to design (research, design thinking, design system, etc.) and talking to people in general, as always can be an opportunity to learn something new. I see it as a chance to improve myself as a professional and put things in practice when I’m creating my solutions.

Over +7 years, I’ve worked on a diverse set of projects, working from research to production, that include iOS, Android, web, SaaS, B2B, B2C, user research, data visualisation, art direction and marketing design.

In all projects, I seek to simplify the relationship between people and the interactive products they use, taking into consideration business goals and technological constraints.

I am self-aware of the impact our solutions have on people's lives, and this is the reason why I always give my best to create a seamless and delightful experience.</p>
